# E-Commerce_Sales_Insights_Using_Python
In this Python-based eCommerce sales analysis project, data cleaning and manipulation were performed to ensure the dataset was accurate and ready for analysis. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) was conducted using the powerful Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn libraries to uncover insights about sales trends and customer behavior.

Key findings were made through identifying the most selling product categories and individual products. These insights are crucial for improving sales strategies, as they help plan inventory and ensure that demand is met effectively. The analysis also enabled better decision-making regarding product stocking, optimizing marketing efforts, and adjusting pricing strategies to boost revenue.

This project showcases how Pythonâ€™s data analysis capabilities can be applied to real-world eCommerce challenges, offering data-driven recommendations to optimize business performance.
